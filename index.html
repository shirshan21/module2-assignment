                        Chicken is a popular option when it comes to lean protein, as it packs a considerable amount into a single serving 
                        without a lot of fat. The amount of calories in chicken can range based on the way that it’s prepared.
                        Chicken makes a fantastic substitute for red meats. A great source of protein, the meat has been linked to a variety of health benefits.

                        Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus). It is categorized as red meat — a term used for the meat of mammals, 
                        which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish.
                        Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced. 
                        Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers.
